Eventually, money will not represent value exchange of goods and services.

Goods and services are the result of human creativity, labor and physical execution.

Humans self survive.

A human that works, expects to reap the reward of that work.

If money is to represent value, and value derives from work, the printing of money will devalue the work.

We cannot sustain the printing of currency and expect that currency to hold its value.
